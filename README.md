**Introduction**

The Stock Market Tracker is a web application that fetches and displays real-time stock market data using the Alpha Vantage API. Users can input a stock symbol, and the application will retrieve the latest stock price information.

This is the first project I have created in Python. 

**Features**

  Fetch real-time stock market data using Alpha Vantage.
  
  User-friendly interface built with Flask.
  
  Display stock information such as symbol, price, and other relevant data.
  
  Extensible for adding more features like historical stock data and graphs.

**Installation**

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository:
     
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/StockMarketTracker.git
     
       cd StockMarketTracker
  
  2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     
       python3 -m venv venv
     
       source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

  3. Install the required dependencies:
     
       pip install -r requirements.txt

  4. Set up your environment variables:
     
     You need to add your Alpha Vantage API key in an .env file or export it directly in your environment:
     
       Create a .env file in the project root:
     
         ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

  5. Run the application:
    
      flask run
   
      The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

**Usage**

  Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
  
  Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla) in the input field.
  
  The app will display the stockâ€™s latest price information retrieved from the Alpha Vantage API.
